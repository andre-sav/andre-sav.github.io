In modern society, there has been some controversy on the topic of video games. Are they purely an entertainment medium, or are they something more? I have performed an analysis on a study pertaining to memory function to dispel some of the fog surrounding the issue. The dataset used was collected by a multinational team of researchers, and their findings were published in “Computers in Human Behavior: Volume 97”. 

First, some background regarding the nature of the study. Various self reported facts were collected regarding experiment participants, such as the amount of time they spent playing video games per week, the specific types of games, and their age. The outcomes were defined via spatial, visual, and n-back (a task used in cognitive neuroscience) working memory measurements.

The results depicted in the visualizations have been verified as statistically significant via the t-test for independence.

My work has revealed there is a clear positive correlation between N-Back, spatial working memory, and the amount of time spent playing video games. Below you will find illustrative visualizations demonstrating this relationship in the form of box plots.

The most prominent positive correlation is found with the n-back test, as shown with the bar chart. The second most significant is with spatial working memory. This is unsurprising as video games frequently require users to engage the same skills necessary for scoring well on such tests. The least correlative relationship is with the verbal working memory test. Interestingly, it doesn’t seem any particular genre of game had a greater impact than the others on cognitive memory test scores.

In conclusion, I’d like to argue that video games indeed have a net benefit to those who play them beyond simply providing entertainment. Though this particular study is not proof of a causal relationship, more research on the matter is being conducted. It is likely to confirm the relationships depicted here.
